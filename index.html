					<strong>1. Avengers:Endgame</strong></td>
						<td class="bg-secondary">
						"Best conclusion of a film since the Harry Potter movie series. This film perfectly wraps up the storylines and character arcs of the mcu since iron man 1. The last battle looks like it is straight out of a comic book and I loved how they concluded it with iron man’s last words being “i am iron man”which is a reference that not only ends his character arc correctly, it also ends the first ten years of the mcu in a very intelligent way and it is truly satisfying. I like how they travel back in time to certain mcu films in the past to really show us how these characters have grown and we have grown watching those mcu films at the time it came out in theatres. I am grateful to experience this masterpiece and a marvellous end to my childhood. It has been such a great journey and it will never be forgotten, I can’t wait for more superhero flicks like this. I love this movie 3000."

						<strong>2. Spiderman: No way home</strong></td>
						<td class="col-lg-5 bg-secondary">
							Without giving too much away …No Way Home has a nice balance of heart felt emotional moments and comedy, Filled with great action scenes and visually beautiful effects. loved every second of it. It really pays homage to each spider man that came before in such a great way. My favorite aspect of the movie is watching the 3 Peter Parker’s  interact. It was amazing to see how they share this empathic understanding of what it means to be spider man down to the deepest levels, and it’s extremely  emotional to watch. You get a glimpse of what their lives were like after we last saw them on screen, and that really made this movie so special. Tom does such an 	amazing job making you laugh but also pull at your heart strings. You can see how much Tobey’s character has grown and matured and how his outlook on life has changed. Andrew’s Peter Parker is still going through it and still harbors a lot of pain…was really sad to see that. I loved this movie from beginning to end. It was a great closing chapter for the past spider men. I’m excited to see what they do with the next movie possibly introducing venom.

							<strong>2. Guardian of the Galaxy Vol. 1</strong></td>
							<td class="col-lg-5 bg-secondary">
								The movie is an eye-opener to the MCU, dragging the attention away from Earth's Mightiest Heroes for a while and bringing up a fresh and robust team-up in the cosmic arena of comic book movies, a genre rarely explored before this releases.
								James Gunn nails the job of connecting C-Lister heroes that are now pop culture icons (especially star-lord).
								Great humour, visuals, action, music, score and cast performances go hand in hand with the direction. It also holds a great imdb score of 8.1.
								The most eye opening characters are star-lord, Yondu, Drax and Thanos who terrifies his daughters and the antagonist Ronan.
								Though it falls prey to the MCU villain problem, it has a good MacGuffin in the form of an Orb.
								It also enlists family values in a unique way uncommon in the genre of comic book movies and has some rude comments which are great!
